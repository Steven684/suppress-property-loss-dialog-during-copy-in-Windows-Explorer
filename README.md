# suppress-windows-copy-loss-properties
This AutoITScript suppresses the "Are you sure you want to copy this file/folder without its properties" message from standard Explorer copy across USB key, external drives, or network.

I don't want to distribute an EXE, for fear of my website getting flagged, so Here's how to install it (takes 10 mins total)
1. download and install AutoITScript from autoITscript.com
2. download the .au3 file abvove here to your desktop.
3. right-click it and choose "complie script (x86)" from the context menu. it creates "stop-copy-dialog.exe" on your desktop.
4. move this exe file in Program Files (or wherever you like)
5. add this exe to your StartUp folder (C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)

Done!   You can uninstall AutoITS and delete the .au3 file.  All you need is the .exe file.

This script will patiently wait for any dialog titled ". When any AUtoITS script is running, you'll see a new icon in your tray. it's a small white tabe with a green square on the left.

I would LOVE IT if someone figured out how to suppress those dialogs in the first place!  But I've tried and can't find such a solution.

If you do, please update the Quora thread, as well as submitting a text file explaining how.

 - I searched forums 
 
 - I googled for half an hour, and remarkably, it seems that doesn't exist.
